## Introduction

The goal of this document to illustrate the use of docker and the Selenium project. The selenium project has released a number of containers to run various tools in the suite. 

### Why Docker?

Running a docker container standardises the build across OS's and removes many of the issues
user may have relating to JAVA/browser version/selenium version etc.


## Preparing Docker on Windows

The following outlines preparing a windows 10 home installation to run docker containers.

### Installing Docker

Depending on your version of windows there are currently two ways of running docker.
Details are given at [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/). For the version of windows Being used in this vignette (win 10 home) the older [Docker toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) is what we are going to use to run containers.

Download the `.exe` for Docker toolbox and begin the install. Follow the instructions on the [toolbox install windows](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) page.

Clicking on the Docker Quickstart terminal link should eventually give you a terminal.


## Preparing Docker on Linux

The following outlines preparing a ubuntu 16.04 installation to run docker containers.

### Installing Docker

For a general guide for various Linux distros see [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/)

#### Ubuntu 16.04

Run system update firstly

```sh
sudo apt-get update
```

Add the official Docker GPG key  to your system

```sh
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D
```


Add the Docker repository to APT sources:

```sh
echo "deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list

```

Update the package database:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
```

Now you should be able to install Docker

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y docker-engine
```

Start the docker daemon.

```sh
sudo service docker start
```

You can check that the Docker is working by running a test container:

For now run as `sudo`

```sh
sudo docker run hello-world

Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
2db29710123e: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:7d246653d0511db2a6b2e0436cfd0e52ac8c066000264b3ce63331ac66dca625
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
```

#### Running without sudo

If you want to run `docker` without `sudo` you can create a docker group and add the appropriate 
user to that group see [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/#create-a-docker-group).


## Using Selenium  Docker Images

The official docker repository can be viewed [here](https://hub.docker.com/u/selenium/) at Docker Hub.

### What's in an Image?

Lets examine the [`selenium/node-firefox`](https://hub.docker.com/r/selenium/node-firefox/) image. The first thing to note is the `Tags`. 

`Tags` tab gives us the various tagged versions of this image. `Dockerfile` tab allows us
to view the source behind the image:

```
FROM selenium/node-base:2.53.0 
MAINTAINER Selenium <selenium-developers@googlegroups.com> 

USER root #========= 
# Firefox 
#========= 
ENV FIREFOX_VERSION 45.0.2 
```

We can see that this image will run selenium server and contain firefox version 45.0.2. 

We will be interested not in the node-firefox image but the [selenium/standalone-firefox](https://hub.docker.com/r/selenium/standalone-firefox/) image. Looking at its Dockerfile we see however that it is built on the first image we looked at.

### Pulling an Image

#### Windows 10 - Docker Toolbox

To get the image we are interested in we first click our quickstart link to open a terminal. 

We then issue the following command:

```sh
docker pull selenium/standalone-firefox:2.53.0
```

Notice we appended a tag version so we are asking for the `2.53.0` version of this image.


#### Ubuntu 16.04 

Similar to windows we use the `docker pull` command. If you did not create and add your user to a `Docker` group you will need to `sudo`

```sh
sudo docker pull selenium/standalone-firefox:2.53.0
```

### Start Your Servers!

When we run an image we refer to that instance of the running image as a container. Importantly for Selenium we are dealing with a server so we require a port. We will have a port on the container and a port on the host machine (the machine that is running the container). The only complexity will involve mapping the host port and container port. 

By default the Selenium images expose port 4444 and use this port for serving. This is not a problem for us and we can map as we see fit on the host machine.

#### Windows 10 Running an Image

Again we run docker and this time use the [`run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command. 

```sh
docker run -d -p 4445:4444 selenium/standalone-firefox:2.53.0
```

For illustration here we are mapping the container port 4444 to the host port 4445 so when we want to refer to our server on the host machine we will use 4445 as the port. 

We also run the [`ps`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/) command after running to show our current running containers.

```batch
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                    NAMES
62446e273bb2   selenium/standalone-firefox:2.53.0   "/opt/bin/entry_poin…"   2 hours ago   Up 2 hours   0.0.0.0:4445->4444/tcp   sleepy_chatterjee
```

So we can see an instance of standalone-firefox:2.53.0 is running. It has `id=ac61567a8f06` and is named `peaceful_aryabhata`.


#### Ubuntu 16.04 Running an Image

For ubuntu we also issue a `run` command followed by a listing of running containers with `ps`.

Again run as `sudo` if necessary:

```sh
sudo docker run -d -p 4445:4444 selenium/standalone-firefox:2.53.0
sudo docker ps

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                    NAMES
62446e273bb2   selenium/standalone-firefox:2.53.0   "/opt/bin/entry_poin…"   2 hours ago   Up 2 hours   0.0.0.0:4445->4444/tcp   sleepy_chatterjee
```

The `Ubuntu` container has `id=5475923fc4dc` and is named `peaceful_payne`.

A tip if you don't want to strain your eyes is to use the `--format` argument:

```sh
sudo docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.ID}}'
```

```
NAMES               IMAGE                                CONTAINER ID
peaceful_payne      selenium/standalone-firefox:2.53.0   5475923fc4dc
```

### RSelenium and Running Containers

Now that we have a container running a selenium server and its own firefox we can call it using `RSelenium`

#### Utilising the Firefox Standalone Container in Windows 10

With Windows 10 we have Docker toolbox which creates a virtual machine on windows to run our containers. So the virtual machine is the host rather than Win 10. We need the ip address of this virtual machine. This is the only added complication. We can get the ip address of the virtual machine using `docker-machine.exe`:

```sh
docker-machine ip
```

```
192.168.99.100
```

So as we can see the virtual machine has `ip = 192.168.99.100` and as we noted previously we mapped port 4444 to port 4445 on the host (the virtual machine in this case). So we should have a Selenium server accessible on port 4445 of the virtual machine. Lets try it:

```R
library(RSelenium)
remDr <- remoteDriver(
  remoteServerAddr = "192.168.99.100",
  port = 4445L
)
remDr$open()
```

```
## [1] "Connecting to remote server"
## $applicationCacheEnabled
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $rotatable
## [1] FALSE
## 
## $handlesAlerts
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $databaseEnabled
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $version
## [1] "45.0.2"
## 
## $platform
## [1] "LINUX"
## 
## $nativeEvents
## [1] FALSE
## 
## $acceptSslCerts
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $webdriver.remote.sessionid
## [1] "bfe1c24d-8b17-4e64-a062-cba14e99472b"
## 
## $webStorageEnabled
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $locationContextEnabled
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $browserName
## [1] "firefox"
## 
## $takesScreenshot
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $javascriptEnabled
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $cssSelectorsEnabled
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $id
## [1] "bfe1c24d-8b17-4e64-a062-cba14e99472b"
```

```R
remDr$navigate("http://www.google.com/ncr")
remDr$getTitle()
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "Google"
```

So as expected we have version `45.0.2` of firefox running in `Linux`. We note that no browser popped up and we don't see any signs in the `MINGW64` console. This is expected the browser is headless. If you are using `RStudio` you can use the `Viewer` pane to get a screenshot `remDr$screenshot(display = TRUE)`. Later we will see how we can run a debug version that uses `VNC` to allow us to interact with the containers browser.

#### Utilising the Firefox Standalone Container in Ubuntu 16.04

On our ubuntu 16.04 box life is simpler. The host in this case is the machine itself. The ip address is therefore `localhost` the default for `RSelenium`:

```R
library(RSelenium)
remDr <- remoteDriver(port = 4445L)
remDr$open()
```

```
## [1] "Connecting to remote server"
## $applicationCacheEnabled
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $rotatable
## [1] FALSE
## 
## $handlesAlerts
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $databaseEnabled
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $version
## [1] "45.0.2"
## 
## $platform
## [1] "LINUX"
## 
## $nativeEvents
## [1] FALSE
## 
## $acceptSslCerts
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $webdriver.remote.sessionid
## [1] "644c353a-34b8-4bb4-bcff-746df5a30af8"
## 
## $webStorageEnabled
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $locationContextEnabled
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $browserName
## [1] "firefox"
## 
## $takesScreenshot
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $javascriptEnabled
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $cssSelectorsEnabled
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $id
## [1] "644c353a-34b8-4bb4-bcff-746df5a30af8"
```

```R
remDr$navigate("http://www.google.com/ncr")
remDr$getTitle()
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "Google"

```

Again we see that we have `Firefox` 45.0.2 running on `Linux`. So running docker containers allows us to run a standard setup OS independent and we don't need to worry about machine specifics.

## Debugging Using VNC

Often it is useful to be able to interact with the browser spawned by Selenium. In this regard the `Selenium` project provides debug versions of their images which include `VNC`. This means with a VNC viewer we can remote logon to the container and interact with the browser.

### Remote Logging/Debugging with Windows

First lets stop the running container. To stop the running container we need its ID. We then pass this id to the [`stop`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/) command:

```sh
docker ps -q
```

```
ac61567a8f06
```

```sh
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```

```
ac61567a8f06
```

```sh
docker ps
```

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

So we have stopped our container and will have no issues with blocked ports. Next we need to [`pull`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/) the [`Firefox standalone debug`](https://hub.docker.com/r/selenium/standalone-firefox-debug/) image. Again this has various tags and we will choose the `2.53.0` one:

```sh
docker pull selenium/standalone-firefox-debug:2.53.0
```

```

Status: Downloaded newer image for selenium/standalone-firefox-debug:2.53.0
```

Next we start the container as before. This time we have two ports to map. The Selenium port as before and also now the VNC port. The Selenium image expose the VNC port on `5900` by default and we map this port to a port on the host. We will choose `5901` just to illustrate host v container:

```sh
docker run -d -p 4445:4444 -p 5901:5900 selenium/standalone-firefox-debug:2.53.0
```

```
ee0c0bb8b711723e653ccc26219e314a37c28d2027f939046adcfc90a4beb645
```

```sh
docker-machine ip
```

```
192.168.99.100
```

```sh
docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.ID}}'
```

```
NAMES               IMAGE                                      CONTAINER ID
focused_tesla       selenium/standalone-firefox-debug:2.53.0   ee0c0bb8b711
```

Again we note that the container is ran on a virtual machine not on our Windows 10 box so we expose the ip of said virtual machine. Next we download a VNC viewer if we don't have one. 

[TightVNC](http://www.tightvnc.com/download.php) has worked for me so I use it here.

Our Selenium server is running so lets use RSelenium again to browse to `Google`:

```R
library(RSelenium)
remDr <- remoteDriver(
  remoteServerAddr = "192.168.99.100",
  port = 4445L
)
remDr$open(silent = TRUE)
remDr$navigate("http://www.google.com/ncr")
remDr$getTitle()
remDr$screenshot(display = TRUE)
```

Now we open `TightVNC` and use the VM ip with appropriate port for VNC.

```
Remote Host: 192.168.99.100:5901
```

You will be asked for a password which is `secret`. This can be seen by reading the images dockerfile:

```
RUN apt-get update -qqy \
  && apt-get -qqy install \
    x11vnc \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
  && mkdir -p ~/.vnc \
&& x11vnc -storepasswd secret ~/.vnc/passwd
```
Enter the password and you should have access to the container browser. Navigate to another website;

```R
remDr$navigate("http://www.bbc.com")
remDr$getTitle()
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "BBC - Homepage"
```

and you should observe the action on the containers browser. Finally stop your containers:

```sh
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```

```
ee0c0bb8b711
```

### Remote Logging/Debugging with Linux

Firstly, we stop any running containers which may block our ports:

```sh
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```

```
5475923fc4dc
```

```sh
docker ps
```

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

Like in windows we `pull` the `2.53.0` version of the `Firefox` standalone debug image (again using `sudo` if necessary:

```sh
sudo docker pull selenium/standalone-firefox-debug:2.53.0
```

```
2.53.0: Pulling from selenium/standalone-firefox-debug

```

Once the image is downloaded we can start it as we did with Windows. We map Selenium to port 4445 on the host and VNC to port 5901. As noted before the host in the case of Ubuntu 16.04 is the machine itself so `localhost` is the relevant ip:

```sh
sudo docker run -d -p 4445:4444 -p 5901:5900 selenium/standalone-firefox-debug:2.53.0
```

```
dd36811562e83e66ab145efcedca2825a621741f10d8c81a5fb3fb5ba3019032
```

```sh
sudo docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.ID}}'
```

```
NAMES               IMAGE                                      CONTAINER ID
thirsty_swanson     selenium/standalone-firefox-debug:2.53.0   dd36811562e8
```

So we can see that Selenium server is running. Like in Windows we need a VNC viewer. You can use `TightVNC` as with windows and a guide to running it is [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-vnc-on-ubuntu-16-04). We will use `Vinagre` however. A guide to install `Vinagre` is [here](https://www.howtoinstall.co/en/ubuntu/xenial/vinagre). Basically we just need to `apt-get` it:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install vinagre
```

Again, we navigate to Google:

```R
library(RSelenium)
remDr <- remoteDriver(port = 4445L)
remDr$open(silent = TRUE)
remDr$navigate("http://www.google.com/ncr")
remDr$getTitle()
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "Google"
```

Now open Vinagre and input the correct ip/port (127.0.0.1:5901 in this case).

Again it will ask for a password which as before is `secret`.

You should now be able to interact with the containers browser. Again navigate to another website and observe the containers browser:

```R
remDr$navigate("http://www.bbc.com")
remDr$getTitle()
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "BBC - Homepage"
```

Finally close the session:

```
remDr$close()
```

And close down any running containers:

```sh
sudo docker stop $(sudo docker ps -q)
```

```
dd36811562e8
```
