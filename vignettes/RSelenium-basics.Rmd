## Introduction

The goal of RSelenium is to make it easy to connect to a Selenium Server/ Remote Selenium Server from within R. RSelenium provides R bindings for the Selenium Webdriver API. [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/) is a project focused on automating web browsers. RSelenium allows you to carry out unit testing and regression testing on your webapps and webpages across a range of browser/OS combinations. This allows us to integrate from within R testing and manipulation of popular projects such as [shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/), [sauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/).

This vignette is divided into six main sections:

Each section will be an introduction to a major idea in Selenium, and point to more detailed explanation in other vignettes.


## <a id="id1">Connecting to a Selenium Server.</a>

### What is a Selenium Server?
Selenium Server is  a standalone java program which allows you to run HTML test suites in a range of different browsers, plus extra options like reporting.
You may, or may not, need to run a Selenium Server, depending on how you intend to use Selenium-WebDriver (RSelenium). 

### Do I need to run a Selenium Server?
If you intend to drive a browser on the same machine that RSelenium is running on then you will need to have Selenium Server running on that machine. 

### How do I get the Selenium Server stand-alone binary?
You can download the latest Selenium Server binary manually it is currently found [here](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html). Look for `selenium-server-standalone-x.xx.x.jar`.

### How do I run the Selenium Server?

The recommended way to run a Selenium Server is by running a Docker 
container. There is a seperate vignette which covers the using `RSelenium`
with Docker see `vignette("RSelenium-docker", package = "RSelenium")`.

For users who are not familiar with Docker there is now a function
`rsDriver` which will manage the binaries needed for running a Selenium 
Server. This provides a wrapper around the `wdman::selenium` function.
For additional options and more control see the [wdman](https://github.com/johndharrison/wdman) project.
Examples using the `rsDriver` function are given in the appendix.
**Please submit any issues with running binaries to the wdman 
project** 

Alternatively you can run the binary manually. Open a console in your OS and navigate to where the binary is located and run:
```
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-x.xx.x.jar
```
By default the `Selenium Server` listens for connections on port 4444.

**Note for Mac OSX: The default port 4444 is sometimes used by other
programs such as kerberos. In our examples we use port 4445 in respect of 
this and for cdonsistency with the Docker vignette.**

### How do I connect to a running server?
`RSelenium` has a main reference class named `remoteDriver`. To connect to a server you need to instantiate a new `remoteDriver` with appropriate options.
```
# Run a server for example using Docker
# docker run -d -p 4445:4444 selenium/standalone-firefox:2.53.1
# Use a debug image with a VNC viewer if you wish to view the browser
# docker run -d -p 5901:5900 -p 127.0.0.1:4445:4444 --link http-server selenium/standalone-firefox-debug:2.53.1
# See Docker vignette for more detail or run a Selenium Server manually.

require(RSelenium)
remDr <- remoteDriver(remoteServerAddr = "localhost" 
                      , port = 4445L
                      , browserName = "firefox"
                      )
```
**Note for Windows: If you are using Docker toolbox your remote server 
address will not be localhost. You need to use the ip address of the VM 
that is running docker for example**
```
$ docker-machine ip
192.168.99.100
```
**See the Docker vignette for further details. The newer Docker for windows
however should be accessible on the localhost.**

It would have been sufficient to call `remDr <- remoteDriver(port = 4445L)` but the options where explicitly listed to show how one may connect to an arbitrary ip/port/browser etc. More detail maybe found on the `sauceLabs` vignette. To connect to the server use the `open` method.

```
remDr$open()
```
RSelenium should now have a connection to the Selenium Server. You can query the status of the remote Server using the `status` method.
```
> remDr$getStatus()

## <a id="id2">Navigating using RSelenium.</a>
### Basic Navigation
To start with we navigate to a url.
```
remDr$navigate("http://www.google.com/ncr")
```
Then we navigate to a second page.
```
remDr$navigate("http://www.bbc.co.uk")

> remDr$getCurrentUrl()
[[1]]
[1] "http://www.bbc.co.uk/"

```
We can go backwards and forwards using the methods `goBack` and `goForward`.

```
remDr$goBack()

> remDr$getCurrentUrl()
[[1]]
[1] "https://www.google.com/"

remDr$goForward()

> remDr$getCurrentUrl()
[[1]]
[1] "http://www.bbc.co.uk/"

```

To refresh the current page you can use the `refresh method.

```
remDr$refresh()

```

## <a id="id3">Accessing elements in the DOM.</a>
The DOM stands for the Document Object Model. It is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML and XML documents. Interacting with the DOM will be very important for us with Selenium and the webDriver provides a number of methods in which to do this.
A basic html page is 

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

```

The query box on the front page of `http://www.google.com` has html code 
`<input id=..... name="q" ...</input>` associated with it. The full html associated with the input tag is:

```
<input spellcheck="false" dir="ltr" style="border: medium none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; height: auto; width: 100%; background: transparent url(&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAID/AMDAwAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw%3D%3D&quot;) repeat scroll 0% 0%; position: absolute; z-index: 6; left: 0px; outline: medium none;" aria-autocomplete="both" role="combobox" aria-haspopup="false" class="gsfi" id="lst-ib" maxlength="2048" name="q" autocomplete="off" title="Search" value="" aria-label="Search" type="text">
```

**NOTE: The above HTML is very liable to change however the input node 
has had an attribute name = q for sometime so we can mostly rely on this.**

### Search by name.

To find this element in the DOM a number of methods can be used. We can search by the name.

```
remDr$navigate("http://www.google.com/ncr")
webElem <- remDr$findElement(using = 'name', value = "q")

> webElem$getElementAttribute("name")
[[1]]
[1] "q"

> webElem$getElementAttribute("class")
[[1]]
[1] "gsfi lst-d-f"

> webElem$getElementAttribute("id")
[[1]]
[1] "lst-ib"

```

### Search by id

In HTML the id of a DOM element should be unique so this is usually a 
good locator to use. As noted above the google id of the query box may 
change (the one we see is "lst-ib" so we use that). You may see an 
alternative "id".

```
remDr$navigate("http://www.google.com/ncr")
webElem <- remDr$findElement(using = 'id', value = "lst-ib")

```

#### Highlight an element

An element that is visible in the DOM can usually be highlighted. Using
our `webElem` which is an object of class `"webElement"` we can use the 
associated `highlight` method to visually indicate to us we have the
correct element. Try it:

```
webElem$highlightElement()
```
You should see the query box flashing black and yellow to indicate 
visually the DOM element you have selected.

### Search by class.
We can also search by class name.

```
remDr$navigate("http://www.google.com/ncr")
webElem <- remDr$findElement(using = 'class', "gsfi")

> webElem$getElementAttribute("class")
[[1]]
[1] "gsfi lst-d-f"

> webElem$getElementAttribute("type")
[[1]]
[1] "text"

```

**NOTE the clas is listed as "gsfi lst-d-f" and we searched using "gsfi"?
This is an example of a compound class. The class name selector can only be
used for elements with a single class ("gsfi lst-d-f" indicates two classes
"gsfi" and "lst-d-f"). For more complicated select queries we therefore use
CSS or xpath instead.**

### Search using css-selectors
To replicate our name search using css selectors we could use

```
webElem <- remDr$findElement(using = 'css', "input[name='q']")

# OR

webElem2 <- remDr$findElement(using = 'css', "[name='q']")

```
We can see we get the same element (using the compareElements method of 
the `"webElement"` class):

```
> webElem$compareElements(webElem2)
[[1]]
[1] TRUE
```

and to search on id using css-selectors (again not the id you see maybe
different)

```
webElem <- remDr$findElement(using = 'css', "input#lst-ib")
> webElem$getElementAttribute("name")
[[1]]
[1] "q"

```


and class

```
webElem <- remDr$findElement('css', "[class = 'gsfi lst-d-f']")
```
**NOTE no issue with compound class names with CSS**

A good example of searching using css-selectors is given [here](http://saucelabs.com/resources/selenium/css-selectors).

### Search using xpath
The final option is to search using xpath. Normally one would use xpath by default when searching or CSS. Both are the go-to options. 

Xpath using id.

```
webElem <- remDr$findElement('xpath', "//input[@id = 'lst-ib']")
```

Xpath using class.

```
webElem <- remDr$findElement('xpath', "//input[@class = 'gsfi lst-d-f']")
```
**NOTE with xpath we have no issues using a compound class name.**

## <a id="id4">Sending events to elements.</a>

To illustrate how to interact with elements we will again use the `http://www.google.com/ncr` as an example.


### Sending text to elements

Suppose we would like to search for `R cran` on google. We would need to find the element for the query box and send the appropriate text to it. We can do this using the `sendKeysToElement` method for the `webElement` class.

```
remDr$navigate("http://www.google.com/ncr")
webElem <- remDr$findElement(using = "css", "[name = 'q']")
webElem$sendKeysToElement(list("R Cran"))

```

### Sending key presses to elements

We should see that the text `R Cran` has now been entered into the query box.
How do we press enter. We can simply send the enter key to query box. The enter key would be denoted as `"\uE007"`(its UTF-8 code) . So we could use:

```
remDr$navigate("http://www.google.com/ncr")
webElem <- remDr$findElement(using = "css", "[name = 'q']")
webElem$sendKeysToElement(list("R Cran", "\uE007"))

```
It is not very easy to remember UTF-8 codes for appropriate keys so a mapping has been provided in `RSelenium`. `?selkeys' will bring up a help page explaining the mapping. The UTF-8 codes have been mapped to easy to remember names. 

To use `selkeys` we would send the following


```
remDr$navigate("http://www.google.com/ncr")
webElem <- remDr$findElement(using = "css", "[name = 'q']")
webElem$sendKeysToElement(list("R Cran", key = "enter"))

```

Typing `selKeys` into the console will bring up the list of mappings.

### Sending mouse events to elements

For this example we will go back to the google frontpage and search for
`R Cran` then we will click the link for the `The Comprehensive R Archive Network`.

```
remDr$navigate("http://www.google.com/ncr")
webElem <- remDr$findElement(using = "css", "[name = 'q']")
webElem$sendKeysToElement(list("R Cran", key = "enter"))

```

The header for each link is contained in a `<h3 class = "r">` tag. We will access the `h3` headers first. It will be succinct to find these elements using `css selectors`.

```
webElems <- remDr$findElements(using = 'css selector', "h3.r")
resHeaders <- unlist(lapply(webElems, function(x){x$getElementText()}))
> resHeaders
 [1] "The Comprehensive R Archive Network"                                   
 [2] "Download R-3.3.2 for Windows. The R-project for statistical ... - CRAN"
 [3] "About Microsoft R Open: The Enhanced R Distribution . MRAN"            
 [4] "R (programming language) - Wikipedia"                                  
 [5] "R-Cran - StatLib - Carnegie Mellon University"                         
 [6] "Submitting your first package to CRAN, my experience | R-bloggers"     
 [7] "Debian -- Package Search Results -- r-cran"                            
 [8] "It's crantastic!"                                                      
 [9] "METACRAN"                                                              
[10] "CRAN - Package PopGenReport"   

```

**NOTE this is how the headers were presented at time of writing. Class
names etc. are liable to change.**
We can see that the first link is the one we want but in case googles search results change we refer to it as 

```
webElem <- webElems[[which(resHeaders == "The Comprehensive R Archive Network")]]

```

How do we click the link. We can use the `clickElement` method:

```
webElem$clickElement()

> remDr$getCurrentUrl()
[[1]]
[1] "https://cran.r-project.org/"

> remDr$getTitle()
[[1]]
[1] "The Comprehensive R Archive Network"
```
## <a id="id5">Injecting JavaScript</a>

Sometimes it is necessary to interact with the current url using JavaScript. This maybe necessary to call bespoke methods or to have more control over the page for example by adding the `JQuery` library to the page if it is missing. `Selenium` has two methods we can use to execute JavaScript namely
`executeScript` and `executeAsyncScript` from the `remoteDriver` class. We return to the google front page to investigate these methods.


### Injecting JavaScript synchronously

Returning to the google homepage we can find the element for the `google` image. The image has `id = "hplogo"` and
we can use this in an xpath or search by id etc to select the element. In this case we use `css selectors`:

```
remDr$navigate("http://www.google.com/ncr")
webElem <- remDr$findElement("css", "img#hplogo")

```

Is the image visible? Clearly it is but we can check using javascript. 

```
> script <- "return document.getElementById('hplogo').hidden;"
> remDr$executeScript(script, args = list())
[[1]]
[1] FALSE

```

Great so the image is not hidden indicated by the `FALSE`. We can hide it executing some simple JavaScript.

```
> script <- "document.getElementById('hplogo').hidden = true; 
             return document.getElementById('hplogo').hidden;"
> remDr$executeScript(script, args = list())
[[1]]
[1] TRUE

```
So now the image is hidden. We used an element here given by `id = "hplogo"`. We had to use the JavaScript function
`getElementById` to access it. It would be nicer if we could have used `webElem` which we had specified earlier. 
If we pass a webElement object as an argument to either `executeScript` or `executeAsyncScript` `RSelenium` will pass it in an appropriate fashion.

```
> script <-"arguments[0].hidden = false; return arguments[0].hidden;"
> remDr$executeScript(script, args = list(webElem))
[[1]]
[1] FALSE

```
Notive how we passed the web element to the method `executeScript`. The script argument defines the script to execute in the form of a function body. The value returned by that function will be returned to the client. The function will be invoked with the provided args. If the function returns an element then this will be returned as an object of class webElement:

```
script <- "return document.getElementsByName('q');"
test <- remDr$executeScript(script, args = list())

> test[[1]]
[1] "remoteDriver fields"
$remoteServerAddr
[1] "localhost"

$port
[1] 4445

$browserName
[1] "firefox"

$version
[1] ""

$platform
[1] "ANY"

$javascript
[1] TRUE

$nativeEvents
[1] TRUE

$extraCapabilities
list()

[1] "webElement fields"
$elementId
[1] "21"

> class(test[[1]])
[1] "webElement"
attr(,"package")
[1] "RSelenium"

```

Try to highlight the element as before:

```
test[[1]]$highlightElement()
```

### Injecting JavaScript asynchronously

I will briefly touch on asynch versus sync calls here. We need to set an 
appropriate asynchronous timeout firstly (that is longer than the async
operation we are likely to carryout but it will ensure we will eventually 
error out in case of an issue)

```
remDr$navigate("http://www.google.com/ncr")
remDr$setAsyncScriptTimeout(10000)

```

Observe:

```
webElem <- remDr$findElement("css", "img#hplogo")
script <- "
cb = arguments[arguments.length -1];
webElem = arguments[0];
setTimeout(function(){webElem.hidden = true; cb('DONE');},5000);"
remDr$executeAsyncScript(script, args = list(webElem))

```

versus

```
remDr$navigate("http://www.google.com/ncr")
webElem <- remDr$findElement("css", "img#hplogo")
script <- "
webElem = arguments[0];
setTimeout(function(){webElem.hidden = true;},5000);
return 'DONE';
"
remDr$executeScript(script, args = list(webElem))

```

The async version waits until the callback (defined as the last argument
`arguments[arguments.length -1]` as JavaScript is zero-indexed) 
is called whereas the sync version returns straight away. In both cases 
the google logo disappears after five seconds.

## <a id="id6">Frames and Windows.</a>

In the context of a web browser, a frame is a part of a web page or browser window which displays content independent of its container, with the ability to load content independently.

### Frames in Selenium

We will demonstrate interacting with frames by way of example. The [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://CRAN.R-project.org/) conveniently
contains frames so we shall use `RSelenium` to interact with it. 
Assume we have a remoteDriver opened.

```
remDr$navigate("https://CRAN.r-project.org/")

> XML::htmlParse(remDr$getPageSource()[[1]])
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd">

<frame frameborder="0" name="banner" src="banner.shtml">
<noframes>
&lt;h1&gt;The Comprehensive R Archive Network&lt;/h1&gt;

Your browser seems not to support frames,
here is the &lt;A href="navbar.html"&gt;contents page&lt;/A&gt; of CRAN.
</noframes>
</frameset>
</html>

```

We can see the content is contained in three frames and we dont appear to have access to the content within a frame. But in the browser we see all the content:

```
remDr$maxWindowSize()
remDr$screenshot(display = TRUE)

```
<h6 align = center>RProject front page</h6>
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/38391057/RSelenium/basics/RProject.png"  title = "RProject front page on linux firefox 26.0" width = '100%'/>

To access the content we have to switch to a frame using the `switchToFrame` method of the `remoteDriver` class. 

```
webElems <- remDr$findElements(using = "tag name", "frame")
# webElems <- remDr$findElements(value = "//frame") # using xpath
# webElems <- remDr$findElements("css", value = "frame") # using css

> sapply(webElems, function(x){x$getElementAttribute("src")})

```
Now we see the source code of the navigation sidePanel. Notice how we used a webElement in the method `switchToFrame`. To further demonstrate we are now "in" this frame lets get all the `href` attributes:

```
webElems <- remDr$findElements("css", "[href]")
sapply(webElems, function(x){x$getElementAttribute("href")})

> unlist(sapply(webElems, function(x){x$getElementAttribute("href")}))
[1] "https://cran.r-project.org/R.css"              
 [2] "https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html"       
 [3] "https://www.r-project.org/news.html"

[13] "https://cran.r-project.org/faqs.html"          
[14] "https://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html"    
```

Notice if we pass a `NULL` value to the method `switchToFrame` we move back to the default view.

```
remDr$switchToFrame(NULL)

</frameset>

<h3>Download and Install R</h3>
      Precompiled binary distributions of the base system and
      contributed packages, <strong>Windows and
      Mac</strong> users most likely want one of these versions of R:
	<ul>
<li><a href="bin/linux/">Download R for Linux</a></li>
	  <li>
<a href="bin/macosx/">Download R for (Mac) OS X</a>
	  </li>
<li><a href="bin/windows/">Download R for Windows</a></li>
	</ul>
    R is part of many Linux distributions, you should check with your Linux package management system in addition to the link above.

<h2>What are R and CRAN?</h2>

<p> R is GNU, a freely available language and environment for
statistical computing and graphics which provides a wide variety of
statistical and graphical techniques: linear and nonlinear modelling,
statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering,
etc. Please consult the <a target="_top" href="https://www.R-project.org/">R project homepage</a> for further information.
</p>

<p> CRAN is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that
store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for
R. Please use the CRAN <a href="mirrors.html">mirror</a> nearest to you to minimize network
load.
</p>

<h2 id="submitting">Submitting to CRAN </h2>

<p>
To submit a package to CRAN,
check that your submission meets the
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/web/packages/policies.html">CRAN
  Repository Policy</a> and then use the
<a href="https://xmpalantir.wu.ac.at/cransubmit/">web form</a>.
</p>

<p>
If this fails, upload to
<a target="_blank" href="ftp://CRAN.R-project.org/incoming/">ftp://CRAN.R-project.org/incoming/</a>
and send an email to
<a href="mailto:CRAN@R-project.org">CRAN@R-project.org</a> following the policy.
Please do not attach submissions to emails, because this will clutter up
the mailboxes of half a dozen people.
</p>

<p>
Note that we generally do not accept submissions of precompiled
binaries due to security reasons. All binary distribution listed above

### Windows in Selenium

The easiest way to illustrate Windows in RSelenium is again by way of example. We will use the "CRAN" website.
First we select the `download R` element in the main frame. 

```
remDr$navigate("https://cran.r-project.org/")
remDr$switchToFrame("banner")
webElems <- remDr$findElements("partial link text", "Download R")

sapply(webElems, function(x) x$getElementText())
[[1]]
[1] "Download R for Linux"

[[2]]
[1] "Download R for (Mac) OS X"

[[3]]
[1] "Download R for Windows"

```

We now send a selection of key presses to the first element to open the link it points to in a new window. If you did it manually you would move the mouse to the element right click on the link press the down arrow key twice then press enter. We will do the same

```
loc <- webElems[[1]]$getElementLocation()

> loc[c('x','y')]
$x
[1] 158

$y
[1] 132

remDr$mouseMoveToLocation(webElement = webElems[[1]]) # move mouse to the element we selected
remDr$click(2) # 2 indicates click the right mouse button
remDr$sendKeysToActiveElement(
  list(key = 'down_arrow', key = 'down_arrow', key = 'enter')
)

```

Notice now that a new windows has opened on the remote browser.

```
> remDr$getCurrentWindowHandle()
[[1]]
[1] "{573d17e5-b95a-41b9-a65f-04092b6a804b}"

> remDr$getWindowHandles()
[[1]]
[1] "{4896393a-c215-4976-b4ca-030d6b75b67d}"

[[2]]
[1] "{69c00f18-d3a7-44d7-a236-c6b5e6c264ff}"

> remDr$getTitle()
[[1]]
[1] "The Comprehensive R Archive Network"

> currWin <- remDr$getCurrentWindowHandle()
> allWins <- unlist(remDr$getWindowHandles())
> otherWindow <- allWins[!allWins %in% currWin[[1]]]
> remDr$switchToWindow(otherWindow)
> remDr$getTitle()
[[1]]
[1] "Index of /bin/linux"

```

So using the code above one can observe how to switch between different windows on the remote browser. 

## Appendix

### Server functions

In previous versions of `RSelenium` there were two functions 
`checkForServer` and `startServer` which were used to download and start a
Selenium binary. These functions are Deprecated/Defunct as users had issue 
with using them cross-platform. They are still in the RSelenium package and can be accessed in the serverUtils directory `file.path(find.package("RSelenium"), "example/serverUtils")`

```
> file.path(find.package("RSelenium"), "example/serverUtils")
[1] "/home/john/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.3/RSelenium/example/serverUtils"
```

They may work for you depending on your platform and setup but are not 
supported.

### rsDriver

The `rsDriver` function is a wrapper for the `selenium` function from the
[wdman](https://cran.r-project.org/package=wdman) package. It allows the
user to manage the binaries used to run a Selenium Server. It returns
an environment containing a "client" and a "server". 

By default it runs a chrome browser. Other browsers (firefox, PhantomJS, 
Internet Explorer (Win)) can be selected using the `browser` argument.

The default port a Selenium Server is run on using the `rsDriver` function
is `port = 4567L`. 

```
rD <- rsDriver(verbose = FALSE)
rD

#> $client
#>   browserName                                   id

```

```
# assign the client to a new variable
remDr <- rD$client
remDr$navigate("http://www.r-project.org")
remDr$getTitle()
