Since Firefox version 48, Mozilla requires all add-ons to be signed. Until
recently, Firefox support in Selenium was exclusively provided by an add-on.
As this add-on is not currently signed, this solution does not work with the
latest Firefox releases. As an alternative, Mozilla are working on a WebDriver
specification compliant implementation named GeckoDriver. Please note that the specification is not complete, and that Selenium itself does not comply with
the specification at this time. This means that features previously available
through Selenium will not be available using GeckoDriver.

Currently we would advise against using the latest firefox/geckodriver with selenium untill the w3c webdriver specification
is complete. If you wish to use firefox we would advise using an older version via a Docker image. See the RSelenium
Docker vignette for more detail:
