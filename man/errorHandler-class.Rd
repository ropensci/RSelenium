\description{
class to handle errors
}
\details{
This class is an internal class used by remoteDriver and webElement. It
describes how drivers may respond. With a wide range of browsers etc
the response can be variable.
}
\section{Fields}{

\describe{
\item{\code{statusCodes}}{A list with status codes and their descriptions.}

\item{\code{status}}{A status code summarizing the result of the command. A
non-zero value indicates that the command failed. A value of one is
not a failure but may  indicate a problem.}

\item{\code{statusclass}}{Class associated with the java library underlying
the server. For Example: org.openqa.selenium.remote.Response}

\item{\code{sessionid}}{An opaque handle used by the server to determine where
to route session-specific commands. This ID should be included in
all future session-commands in place of the :sessionId path segment
variable.}

\item{\code{hcode}}{A list}

\item{\code{value}}{A list containing detailed information regarding possible
errors:
\describe{
\item{\code{message}:}{A descriptive message for the command
failure.}
\item{\code{screen}:}{string   (Optional) If included, a
screenshot of the current page as a base64 encoded string.}
\item{\code{class}:}{string   (Optional) If included, specifies
the fully qualified class name for the exception that was thrown
when the command failed.}
\item{\code{stackTrace}:}{array   (Optional) If included,
specifies an array of JSON objects describing the stack trace
for the exception that was thrown when the command failed. The
zeroth element of the array represents the top of the stack.}
}}

\item{\code{responseheader}}{There are two levels of error handling specified
by the wire protocol: invalid requests and failed commands.
Invalid Requests will probably be indicted by a status of 1.

All invalid requests should result in the server returning a 4xx HTTP
response. The response Content-Type should be set to text/plain and
the message body should be a descriptive error message. The
categories of invalid requests are as follows:
\describe{
\item{\code{Unknown Commands}:}{
If the server receives a command request whose path is not mapped
to a resource in the REST service, it should respond with a 404
Not Found message.
}
\item{\code{Unimplemented Commands}:}{
Every server implementing the WebDriver wire protocol must
respond to every defined command. If an individual command has
not been implemented on the server, the server should respond
with a 501 Not Implemented error message. Note this is the only
error in the Invalid Request category that does not return a 4xx
status code.
}
\item{\code{Variable Resource Not Found}:}{
If a request path maps to a variable resource, but that resource
does not exist, then the server should respond with a 404 Not
Found. For example, if ID my-session is not a valid session ID
on the server, and a command is sent to GET /session/my-session
HTTP/1.1, then the server should gracefully return a 404.
}
\item{\code{Invalid Command Method}:}{
If a request path maps to a valid resource, but that resource
does not respond to the request method, the server should
respond with a 405 Method Not Allowed. The response must include
an Allows header with a list of the allowed methods for the
requested resource.
}
\item{\code{Missing Command Parameters}:}{
If a POST/PUT command maps to a resource that expects a set of
JSON parameters, and the response body does not include one of
those parameters, the server should respond with a 400 Bad
Request. The response body should list the missing parameters.
}
}}

\item{\code{debugheader}}{Not currently implemented}
}}

\section{Methods}{

\describe{
\item{\code{checkStatus(resContent)}}{An internal method to check the status returned by the server. If
status indicates an error an appropriate error message is thrown.}

\item{\code{errorDetails(type = "value")}}{Return error details. Type can one of c("value", "class",
"status")}

\item{\code{obscureUrlPassword(url)}}{Replaces the username and password of url with ****}

\item{\code{queryRD(ipAddr, method = "GET", qdata = NULL)}}{A method to communicate with the remote server implementing the
JSON wire protocol.}
}}
